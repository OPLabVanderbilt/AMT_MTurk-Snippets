You can use this template when publishing "Survey Link" to Amazon MTurk.

Until further notice, use "SurveyLink_Template_UseThisForNow.html" to avoid AMT assignment ID duplicates.

1) Go to "Create > New Project > Survey Link" from MTurk requester site.
2) In the "(2) Design Layout" tab, click on the "Source" toggle button, and you will see some html code on that page.
3) Open "SurveyLink_Template.html" file with text editor.
4) Edit line 59 to a proper amount of time.
5) Edit line 60 to point to your test URL (WARNING: shortened URLs may not trasfer worker IDs correctly).
6) Delete all html code in the text box in the "(2) Design Layout" tab. Copy the code you edited in 5) and paste it to the text box.

 Ask Oakyoon, if you are not sure what to do.
